# Write a python program to check if a list of interger is empty 

MyList = [20,]  # Define a list with one integer element

# Check if the list is empty by comparing its length to zero
if len(MyList) == 0:
    print("The List is Empty \n")  # This runs if the list has no elements
else:
    print("It has some values\n")  # This runs if the list has one or more elements
